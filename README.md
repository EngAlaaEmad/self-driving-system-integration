# Self driving Car - Nanodegree Final

Capstone Project for Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree

## Introducing

The goal of the project is to capsulate the whole gained knowledge of the "Self driving car"-Nanodegree course and use it to control a real-driving-car on a test-track.
The project uses the so called [Roboter-Operating-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Operating_System) (short: ROS) which is a framework mostly used in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.
